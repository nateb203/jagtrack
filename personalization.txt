CHOICE POINT #1: COLOR THEME
Option Chosen: [A, B, C, or D] D
Explanation: [3-5 sentences about your color choices, why they work well together, and any accessibility considerations you made]
I chose to do a dark themed as I didn't like all the bright colors I felt it works better to be mostly darkness. 
I put the black with a blue accent as the links at the bottom were also a blue accent just as hyperlinks are but I thought it wouldn't be too bad to combine it together. 
They just work together as I like blue and if this is being personzalized for me I like it but its a soft blue so it doesn't strain me.

REFLECTION


What I Learned:
[Write 5-8 sentences reflecting on Module 1:
- What Bootstrap concepts made sense to you?
- What was most challenging?
- How do you feel about your CSS customization?
- What would you add to JagTrack in the future?
- How will you use this site for planning next quarter?]


All of the dependencies were challenging as I was just copying what was in the google document.
I feel good some parts were confusing but it was overal okay.
I wouldn't add anything as I will be done with high school soon.
I probably won't use this site, while it is a good idea I don't have a need for it. 

Hours Spent: [Approximate time on this module] probably like 3-4 as I reset it a few times for breakage
